    # my SSH connections and

    # the connections are technically
    # "dead" on my side. I can't find
    # out it's really dead until I
    # write to the socket. Super
    # annoying for my 'keep-tunnels-up'
    # scriptt that will bring a tunnel
    # back up when it drops, since it will
    # only die when I try to attempt any
    # sort of activity
